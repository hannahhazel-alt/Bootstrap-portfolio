## Description

I wanted to understand Bootstrap more so I used it to create a more interactive portfolio of my work. This helps me understand Bootstrap and how to impliment their styles to my webpage. This also helps me save time because it is quicker than building a webpage from scratch.
I think I learnt a lot about Bootstrap during my experimentation, the hardest thing was putting the cards into the columns. I would love to build on this and find out how to further manipulate the styles that I used into my asthetic. This has built up a lot of confidence in my ability to potenially noticing how to fix an issue and has fed my hunger into learning more. I think this project makes me stand out again because of the bright colours used, the images and the personality that shines through.
